# Member Login
A simple module that tracks each time a user logs in and stores browser name, platform, browser version and user ID into your database.


Note: Current user font color will turn red.

## Installation
Install, and activate the module as you would any other module. As soon as the
module is active, then logins will be recorded in your database.

Note: After installation the member login table will show on /admin/people/member-login.
